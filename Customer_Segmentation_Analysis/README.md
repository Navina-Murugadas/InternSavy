# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS USING PYTHON
This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and implementation of customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. Customer segmentation is a vital marketing strategy that allows businesses to divide their customer base into distinct groups based on their characteristics and behaviors. K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for this purpose.

# Machine Learning Algorithm used:
K-Means Clustering

# Tools/Technologies used:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python language
3. Numpy library
4. Pandas - Data Cleaning
5. Matplotlib - Data Visualization
6. SkLearn - Model Building
7. Microsoft Excel

# Prerequisites:
1. A prior knowledge of Python programming language along with its libraries for data science such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SkLearn is needed.
2. Installation of required libraries

# Key Features:
## Data Preprocessing
The project includes data preprocessing steps to clean, transform, and prepare the customer data for clustering analysis.
## Elbow Method
Utilization of the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset.
## K-Means Clustering
Implementation of the K-Means algorithm to cluster customers into segments based on defined features.
## Visualization
Creation of informative visualizations, such as scatter plots and cluster profiles, to help interpret and present the results.

# Acknowledgments:
This project is inspired by the need for data-driven customer segmentation, which can provide valuable insights for businesses and marketers. It leverages the power of K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
