# PREDICTION OF GRADUATE ADMISSIONS FROM AN INDIAN PERSPECTIVE USING CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUE
This GitHub project is dedicated to the development and implementation of a machine learning model for predicting graduate admissions for Indian students. The aim of this project is to provide aspiring students and educational institutions in India with a tool to estimate the probability of admission into postgraduate programs based on certain input parameters.

# Motivation
Graduate admissions are a crucial aspect of a student's academic journey. This project was initiated to address the need for a transparent, data-driven solution to help students and institutions in India make more informed decisions. By leveraging classification techniques in machine learning, we aim to provide a predictive tool that considers various factors that influence the admission process.

# Machine Learning Algorithm used:
Linear Regression

# Tools/Technologies used:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python language
3. Numpy library
4. Pandas - Data Manipulation
5. Matplotlib - Data Visualization
6. Seaborn - Data Visualization
7. SkLearn - Model Building
8. Microsoft Excel
9. Streamlit - Framework

# Prerequisites:
1. A prior knowledge of Python programming language along with its libraries for data science such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SkLearn is needed.
2. Installation of required libraries

# Methodology:
The project uses the following steps to accomplish the classification task:
## Data Preprocessing
We clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as needed.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We perform an in-depth EDA to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between various features and survival.
## Model Selection
We implement a linear regression model, for predicting the chance of admission in range of 0 to 1 and classify as following:
1. High chances of Admit
2. Moderate chances of Admit
3. Low chances of Admit
## Model Evaluation
We assess the model's performance using relevant metric - Accuracy.
## Deployment
We provide a sample implementation of the model that can be used to predict the survival of new passengers using Streamlit.
