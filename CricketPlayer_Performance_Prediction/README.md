# CRICKET PLAYER PERFORMANCE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
Cricket Player Performance Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at developing a predictive model to assess and forecast the performance of cricket players. By analyzing historical player statistics and relevant data, this project strives to provide insights and predictions about a player's future performance in batting.

# Machine Learning Algorithm used:
Random Forest Classifier

# Tools/Technologies used:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python language
3. Numpy library
4. Pandas - Data Manipulation
5. Matplotlib - Data Visualization
6. Seaborn - Data Visualization
7. SkLearn - Model Building
8. Microsoft Excel

# Prerequisites:
1. A prior knowledge of Python programming language along with its libraries for data science such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SkLearn is needed.
2. Installation of required libraries

# Project Structure:
The project is organized into the following main components:
## Data Collection
Collect historical cricket player data from reliable sources, such as websites, APIs, or databases.
## Data Preprocessing
Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis, ensuring it is suitable for machine learning.
## Feature Engineering
Extract and engineer relevant features that can influence player performance predictions.
## Machine Learning Models
Develop and train machine learning models to predict player performance. 

# Conclusion:
Machine learning has the potential to assist in cricket player performance prediction, offering data-driven insights that can complement traditional methods. However, it should be approached with care, considering the unique challenges and contextual factors in the sport. Collaborations between data scientists, cricket experts, and players can yield the most effective solutions in this domain.
